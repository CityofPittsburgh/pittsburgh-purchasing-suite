Pittsburgh Purchasing Suite
=======================================================

What is it?
-----------

The Pittsburgh Purchasing Suite is a collection of small apps backed by a common database. These small pieces communicate together to allow people to manage, view, search for, and advertise contract opportunities.

Who uses it?
------------

There are three primary components of the Pittsburgh Purchasing Suite each serve different users:

* :doc:`/beacon` is a tool for City Purchasers to advertise new opportunities and businesses to sign up to receive information about those opportunities.
* :doc:`/scout` is a tool for City Purchasers to search for contract information, including line item information, and subscribe to receive updates when a contract is about to expire.
* :doc:`/conductor` is a tool for centralized contract management. It provides the capability to track contracts as they move through a renewal process along with metrics dashboards and visualizations of that process.
