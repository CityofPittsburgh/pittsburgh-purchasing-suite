    2. Try to get or create the contract stages for the passed
       :py:class:`~purchasing.data.flows.Flow`
    3. Inspect the output for the "revert" flag -- if the flag is set,
       that means that we are resetting the entry time on the first stage.
       In order to do this, we clear out the current stage information, which
