          <ul>
            <!-- determining whether this is a requirement or not <li>A state tax ID from any state in the US. If you'd like to register your business for a Pennsylvania tax ID, you can do so <a href="https://www.pa100.state.pa.us/Registration.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</li> -->
            <li>A federal tax ID number, also known as an EIN (Employer Identification Number).

            </ul>

          <p>Some contracts require these additional documents:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>An insurance certificate from your insurer, which is used to prove your business can cover liabilities.</li>
           <li>Bid bonds and performance bonds, which are used to guarantee that contractors who win the contract will accept it and complete it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>If my business is minority, woman, or veteran-owned, what documentation do I need?</strong></h3>
