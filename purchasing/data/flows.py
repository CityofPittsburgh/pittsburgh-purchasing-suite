    '''Model for flows

    A Flow is the series of :py:class:`~purchasing.data.stages.Stage` objects
    that a contract will go through as part of Conductor. It is meant to be
    as configurable and flexible as possible. Because of the nature of Flows,
    it is best to not allow them to be edited or deleted once they are in use.
    Instead, there is an ``is_archived`` flag. This is because of the difficulty
    of knowing how to handle contracts that are currently in the middle of a flow
    if that flow is edited. Instead, it is better to create a new flow.

    Attributes:
        id: Primary key unique ID
        flow_name: Name of this flow
        contract: Many-to-one relationship with
            :py:class:`~purchasing.data.contracts.ContractBase` (many
            contracts can share a flow)
        stage_order: Array of stage_id integers
